# Mission Control 1.0

This is an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc)-driven toy for my kids to pretend to launch a space ship or control air traffic. 

I've spent more time building it than my kids will probably spend playing with it, but it's been fun to build. 

See it in action at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kblno1MsgNM. 

Enjoy!
